# dropsAlpha : used in the EWMA: sdrops = (1-dropsAlpha) * sdrops + dropsAlpha * drops_messured.
# nrofCopiesAlpha : used in the EWMA: 
# sNrofCopies = (1-nrofCopiesAlpha) * sNrofCopies + nrofCopiesAlpha * nrofCopiesAlpha_messured.
# directivesAlpha : used in the EWMA function to pondarate the number of copies considered after 
# evaluating the drops in regard to the number of copies got from other directives. By default is 0.
# dropsThreshold : if the drops mesured >= dropsThreshold the number of copies of the message is decreased.
# If not specified, by default, is set to 0.

# bufferSize: size of the message buffer (bytes)
# router: router used to route messages (valid class name from routing package)
# activeTimes: Time intervals when the nodes in the group are active (start1, end1, start2, end2, ...)
# msgTtl : TTL (minutes) of the messages created by this host group, default=infinite
# type: Set to "controller" if the node is a controller. If this setting is not 
# specified, which is the default case, the node is not a controller.
